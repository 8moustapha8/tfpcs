The friendly product comparison script.

## About
Tfpcs stands for the friendly product comparison script. It is a mini cms which allows you to list your products which can be filtered and compared by your users. To be honest it could very well be used to compare other things as well.

2017 - I made this for a work experiance placement. Looking back on it, the project was dreadful. But hey!
