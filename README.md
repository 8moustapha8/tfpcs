# tfpcs
The friendly product comparison script.

##About
Tfpcs stand for the friendly product comparison script. It is a mini cms which allows you to list your products which can be filtered and
compared by your users. To be honest it could very well be used to compare other things as well.

##Install
Hopefully installing should be pretty swift.

1) Make a database for the site.  
2) Place all of the files inside the directory you would like the site to run on.  
3) Go to install.php in your browser.  
4) Once you have completed the installation make sure to delete install.php.  
5) Go to /admin/ to get started!
